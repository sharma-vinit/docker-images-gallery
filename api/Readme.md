In the Dockerfile setup, there are a couple of key differences between the Step 1 (`pipenv lock`) and Step 2 (`pipenv update`) that are important to understand, especially in terms of how they interact with your Pipfile and Pipfile.lock:

### Approach 1: Using `pipenv lock`
- **Purpose**: This command is used to regenerate the `Pipfile.lock` based on the current specifications in the `Pipfile`. It does not install new packages or update existing packages. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the `Pipfile.lock` reflects any changes made to the `Pipfile` without modifying the environment.
- **Use Case**: You would use `pipenv lock` when you have updated the `Pipfile` manually (e.g., changed the version of a package) and want to update the `Pipfile.lock` to match these changes. This is crucial for consistency between the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` and for predictable builds in environments like Docker.
- **Outcome**: The `Pipfile.lock` file is updated to match the `Pipfile`, but no packages are installed or updated in the virtual environment at this stage.

### Approach 2: Using `pipenv update`
- **Purpose**: This command updates all packages to their latest versions allowable under the constraints defined in the `Pipfile` and updates the `Pipfile.lock` accordingly. It effectively combines `pipenv lock` (to update the lock file) with `pipenv install` (to install these updates).
- **Use Case**: You would use `pipenv update` when you want to ensure that all packages are up-to-date within the constraints specified in the `Pipfile`. This is often used in development environments where keeping dependencies updated is critical.
- **Outcome**: Both the `Pipfile.lock` is updated, and all dependencies are also updated in the virtual environment. This ensures that your environment uses the latest versions of packages that still comply with the version constraints specified in the `Pipfile`.

### Choosing Between the Two
- **Regenerating the Lock File**: If you are sure about the versions specified in your `Pipfile` and simply need to update the lock file to reflect these versions, use `pipenv lock`.
- **Updating Dependencies**: If your goal is to update all dependencies to the newest versions allowed by the `Pipfile` constraints and also regenerate the lock file, use `pipenv update`.

In a Docker environment, the choice between these commands can affect the reproducibility and stability of your builds:
- For **stable production environments**, you might prefer using `pipenv lock` to maintain consistent builds.
- For **development environments** where staying current with the latest versions of dependencies is more important, `pipenv update` might be more appropriate.

# Docker Commands Explanation

## 1. `docker build -t images-gallery-api .`
- **Purpose**: This command builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).
- **Details**: The `-t images-gallery-api` option tags the resulting image with the name `images-gallery-api`, making it easier to refer to the image later.

## 2. `docker images`
- **Purpose**: Lists all the Docker images that are currently stored locally on your machine.
- **Details**: This command is useful for viewing the available images, their repository tags, the size of each image, and other details.

## 3. `docker rmi images-gallery-api`
- **Purpose**: Removes the Docker image named `images-gallery-api`.
- **Details**: This is used to clean up images that are no longer needed, freeing up disk space. If the image is in use by any containers, you need to remove those containers first or use the `-f` (force) option to force removal.

## 4. `docker run --name api-service -p 5050:5050 images-gallery-api`
- **Purpose**: Runs a container named `api-service` using the `images-gallery-api` image.
- **Details**: 
  - `--name api-service` assigns the name `api-service` to the new container.
  - `-p 5050:5050` maps port 5050 of the container to port 5050 on the host, making the application accessible on the specified host port.
  
## 5. `docker ps`
- **Purpose**: Lists all currently running containers.
- **Details**: This command shows a snapshot of the current state of containers, including their IDs, image names, status, and other details. Using `docker ps -a` shows all containers, not just the running ones.

## 6. `docker exec -it api-service bash`
- **Purpose**: Executes an interactive bash shell inside the running container named `api-service`.
- **Details**:
  - `-it` makes the command interactive and allocates a pseudo-TTY, which is necessary for running a shell session.
  - `bash` is the command executed within the container, launching a bash shell for direct interaction.


```sh
root@6dc6dba0142d:/app# ps -x
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 ?        Ss     0:05 /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/app-4PlAip0Q/bin/python main.py
    8 ?        Sl     0:04 /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/app-4PlAip0Q/bin/python main.py
   10 pts/0    Ss     0:00 bash
   18 pts/0    R+     0:00 ps -x
```

### Process List Inside the Container

- **PID**: Process ID.
- **TTY**: Terminal type that the process is attached to.
- **STAT**: Process state.
- **TIME**: Cumulative CPU time.
- **COMMAND**: Command line or command executed.

| PID | TTY  | STAT | TIME   | COMMAND                                                    |
|-----|------|------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | ?    | Ss   | 0:05   | /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/app-4PlAip0Q/bin/python main.py |
| 8   | ?    | Sl   | 0:04   | /root/.local/share/virtualenvs/app-4PlAip0Q/bin/python main.py |
| 10  | pts/0| Ss   | 0:00   | bash                                                       |
| 18  | pts/0| R+   | 0:00   | ps -x                                                      |

#### Explanation of Columns:
- **PID (Process ID)**: Unique identifier for each running process.
- **TTY (Terminal Type)**: '?' indicates that the process is not attached to any terminal; `pts/0` indicates a pseudoterminal slave where the user can interact (like a terminal window).
- **STAT (Process Status)**:
  - `S` (interruptible sleep): waiting for an event to complete.
  - `s` (session leader): The process is the leader of the session.
  - `l` (is multi-threaded): after multithreading enhancements.
  - `R` (running or runnable): either running or ready to run.
  - `+` (in the foreground process group).
- **TIME (CPU Time)**: This shows how much CPU time the process has consumed since it started.
- **COMMAND (Command Line)**:
  - The first and second entries (`PID 1` and `PID 8`) show Python processes running `main.py`. It appears that `main.py` might be running twice, potentially in different modes (like one for the application and another for background tasks).
  - `PID 10` shows the `bash` shell that you're currently using within the container.
  - `PID 18` shows the `ps -x` command you just executed to list the processes.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Interactive Bash Shell**: You are interacting with the container through a bash shell, which is shown as a process.
- **Real-Time Process Viewing**: The `ps -x` command itself appears as a process as you are requesting real-time process information.
